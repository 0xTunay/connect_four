# Connect Four

## Overview

Connect Four is a two-player game where players take turns dropping their chosen symbols into a vertical grid. The objective is to connect four of your own symbols in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

## Game Setup

- **Players**: 2
- **Symbols**: 
  <div style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 5px; border-radius: 3px;">
    <code>*</code> and <code>0</code>
  </div>
- **Grid**: 6 rows x 7 columns

## Objective

To win the game, a player must align four of their symbols in a row vertically. The game ends when a player achieves this or the grid becomes full.

## Rules

1. Players alternate turns, dropping their chosen symbol into any column.
2. Symbols fall straight down and occupy the lowest available space within the column.
3. The first player to connect four of their symbols vertically wins the game.
4. If the grid fills up without a player connecting four symbols, the game ends in a draw.

## Example

Here's an example of a game grid where the player with symbol `*` has won by connecting four symbols vertically:
